# SEM005: Missing Conformity Claims

**Severity:** Info
**Category:** Semantic Validation

## Description

At least one `conformityClaim` is recommended for a complete DPP.

## Rule Details

Conformity claims document compliance with standards, certifications, or regulations. While not strictly required, their absence suggests an incomplete passport that may not meet regulatory expectations.

## Example

### Flagged

```json
{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "product": {
      "name": "Organic Cotton T-Shirt"
    }
  }
}
```

**Message:** `No conformity claims present. Consider adding sustainability or compliance claims.`

### Recommended

```json
{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "product": {
      "name": "Organic Cotton T-Shirt"
    },
    "conformityClaim": [
      {
        "type": "Certification",
        "conformityTopic": "environment.organic",
        "referenceStandard": "GOTS",
        "assessmentLevel": "ThirdParty"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How to Fix

Add relevant conformity claims for:

1. **Certifications**: GOTS, OEKO-TEX, FSC, etc.
1. **Compliance**: EU ESPR, REACH, RoHS
1. **Standards**: ISO certifications, industry standards
