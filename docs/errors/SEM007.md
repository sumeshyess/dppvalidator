# SEM007: Operational Scope for Emissions

**Severity:** Warning
**Category:** Semantic Validation

## Description

Emissions data with `carbonFootprint` should specify `operationalScope`.

## Rule Details

Carbon footprint values are meaningless without context about what operations are included. The operational scope (e.g., Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions) is essential for:

- Comparability between products
- Regulatory compliance
- Accurate sustainability reporting

## Example

### Invalid

```json
{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "emissionsScorecard": {
      "carbonFootprint": 12.5
    }
  }
}
```

**Message:** `carbonFootprint is specified but operationalScope is missing`

### Valid

```json
{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "emissionsScorecard": {
      "carbonFootprint": 12.5,
      "operationalScope": "Scope1And2",
      "unit": "kgCO2e"
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Fix

Add `operationalScope` with one of:

- `Scope1`: Direct emissions from owned/controlled sources
- `Scope2`: Indirect emissions from purchased energy
- `Scope1And2`: Combined Scope 1 and 2
- `Scope3`: All other indirect emissions
- `CradleToGate`: All emissions up to product completion
- `CradleToGrave`: Full lifecycle emissions
